# MeetZone

#### Do you like sports but have no one to play with? MeetZone is the solution - choose a place, time, type of sport and go out to play with strangers! Not only will you spend your time actively, but you will also have the opportunity to meet new people.

Project built as a final project for CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course.
